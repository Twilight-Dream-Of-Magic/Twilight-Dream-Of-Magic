## üìñ I‚Äôm currently worked done

- [TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn):
A code base of utilities that use multiple algorithms to encrypt or decrypt data, validate data, etc.
(Implement file read/write processing functionality, maybe in the future?)

- [Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic): 
A C++-based research library for symmetric encryption and decryption, containing my OaldresPuzzleCryptic and Little OaldresPuzzleCryptic algorithms (although these two algorithms are placed in the `OOP/BlockCipher` folder and the `OOP/StreamCipher` folder, they are actually mathematically different implementations. they actually use different mathematical implementations. 
I call them both by this name because these algorithms are actually very difficult to crack, and both algorithms can be a good defense against the future growth of quantum computing with respect to quantum bits, and I propose a good defense against shortening the speed of cracking. 
(And the name means: a maze of puzzles as hard to crack as a mythical dragon.) 
However, because of the design characteristics of the two ciphers themselves: the block cipher is a heavyweight cryptography, and the stream cipher is a lightweight cryptography. I hope you will like these two algorithms.


## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...

- [PasswordManagerGUI](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/PasswordManagerGUI):
A Utility GUI program to protect and manage passwords using my utility codebase TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn.

- [LargeDynamicBitSet](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/LargeDynamicBitSet): 
A bit set based on an array of 32-bit numbers. As a result, it can represent large numbers that are not representable by native c++ and can be used for scientific computing. 
(Under development, feel free to submit bugs.)

- [c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit): 
A practical code toolkit written in C#. 
(This is a utility code repository, I had little interest in writing it, there may be some useful data structure and algorithmic logic functions later.)

## History until 2022 ‚öôÔ∏è Project:

- [BackDoorProgram-WindowsProcessExplorer](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/BackDoorProgram-WindowsProcessExplorer): A tool for exploring Windows system process objects.
- [BackDoorProgram-WindowsSystemPowerExplorer](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/BackDoorProgram-WindowsSystemPowerExplorer): A tool for exploring Windows system power.
- [TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile): A program for calculating file data to achieve encryption and decryption.
- [MyMinecraftForgeModdingProject_SuperWorldGem_1.7.10](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/MyMinecraftForgeModdingProject_SuperWorldGem_1.7.10): A Minecraft 1.7.10 forge modding project (About SuperWorldGem).
