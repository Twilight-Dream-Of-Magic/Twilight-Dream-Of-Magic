## 📖 I’m currently worked done

- [TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn):
A code base of utilities that use multiple algorithms to encrypt or decrypt data, validate data, etc.
(Implement file read/write processing functionality, maybe in the future?)

- [LargeDynamicBitSet](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/LargeDynamicBitSet):
This is a dynamic bit set implementation that utilizes arrays of 32-bit numbers.
This project is currently under development, bug reports and contributions are welcome to help improve its functionality.

- [Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic): 
A C++-based research library for symmetric encryption and decryption, containing my OaldresPuzzleCryptic and Little OaldresPuzzleCryptic algorithms (although these two algorithms are placed in the `OOP/BlockCipher` folder and the `OOP/StreamCipher` folder, they are actually mathematically different implementations. they actually use different mathematical implementations. 
I call them both by this name because these algorithms are actually very difficult to crack, and both algorithms can be a good defense against the future growth of quantum computing with respect to quantum bits, and I propose a good defense against shortening the speed of cracking. 
(And the name means: a maze of puzzles as hard to crack as a mythical dragon.) 
However, because of the design characteristics of the two ciphers themselves: the block cipher is a heavyweight cryptography, and the stream cipher is a lightweight cryptography. I hope you will like these two algorithms.

- [mio](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/mio)
This repository is a fork of the mio project, a high-performance memory-mapped I/O library for C++.
The original project is designed to provide efficient memory-mapped file handling, enabling fast and scalable I/O operations.​
- 🔧 **Features**
    - Memory-Mapped I/O: Utilizes memory-mapped files to allow applications to access files as if they were part of the virtual memory, leading to faster data access.​
    - C++ Standard Library Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the C++ Standard Library, providing a familiar and consistent interface for developers.​
    - Cross-Platform Support: Designed to work across various platforms, ensuring portability and wide applicability.​
- 🔄 **Contributions**
In February 2022, the repository owner, Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic, contributed to the project by proposing enhancements for C++20 template concept support.
This contribution aimed to refine the codebase and improve its compatibility with modern C++ standards.
The proposed changes were discussed and shared with the community, reflecting an active engagement in the project's development

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- [PasswordManagerGUI](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/PasswordManagerGUI):
A PasswordManagerGUI is a utility GUI program built on the TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn codebase, designed to protect and manage passwords and file data locally.
It provides local login/logout management with secure storage and efficient encryption/decryption, making it ideal for scenarios that require offline handling of passwords and file data.

- [Easy-BigInteger](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/Easy-BigInteger)
A user-friendly class for working with large integers, designed with cryptography and binary math operations in mind.
The library is designed for MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) and is currently under development (Work In Progress).
Ideal for scientific computing and application scenarios that require high efficiency in bit manipulation.
Enables the representation of large numbers beyond the native capabilities of standard C++ data types.
It simplifies the creation, manipulation, and handling of large integers, and is an invaluable tool for those working with cryptographic algorithms or mathematical calculations that require the use of large numbers.
Based on this robust BigInteger class, we have also developed a BigFraction class that provides precise operations for rational numbers, avoiding the pitfalls of floating point arithmetic.
Furthermore, to verify the correctness and practical applicability of our BigInteger implementation, we have implemented the RSA cryptosystem along with China’s SM2 elliptic curve cryptography.
These additional modules not only serve as test cases for the integrity of our BigInteger operations but also highlight its versatility in supporting advanced cryptographic algorithms.
  **Easy-BigInteger Additional Features:**
  - **Big Fraction Class:** Based on the big integer implementation, we have also developed a big fraction class to handle rational number computations with high precision.
  - **Cryptographic Testing:** To verify the correctness and robustness of our big integer operations, we have implemented both the RSA asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithm and the Chinese SM2 asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithm, specifically using the P256V1 elliptic curve.
Also, you look this C++ easy bitset [LargeDynamicBitSet](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/LargeDynamicBitSet)

- [c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit): 
A practical code toolkit written in C#. 
(This is a utility code repository, I had little interest in writing it, there may be some useful data structure and algorithmic logic functions later.)

- 🔥 [HotUpdates_XLuaFramework](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/HotUpdates_XLuaFramework)
This Unity C# framework facilitates Lua-based hot updates, enabling dynamic script execution and seamless content updates without requiring full application redeployment
- 🔧 Key Features
    - **Lua Integration** Utilizes XLua to integrate Lua scripting, allowing developers to write and execute Lua scripts within Unit.
    - **Hot Update Mechanism** Supports downloading and applying Lua scripts at runtime, enabling on-the-fly updates to game logic and conten.
    - **Modular Architecture** Organizes Lua scripts and resources into bundles, facilitating efficient management and update.
    - **Version Control** Employs versioning to ensure compatibility and integrity of update.
    - **Bug Reporting** Encourages community involvement by welcoming bug reports and contributions via GitHub issue.

- 🔐 Security with LittleOPC Encryptio
To enhance the security of Lua scripts, this framework incorporates the **LittleOPC (OaldresPuzzle-Cryptic)** lightweight symmetric encryption algoritm Developed and implemented in C#, LittleOPC ensures that Lua scripts are encrypted during transmission and storage, protecting against unauthorized access and tamperig.
The algorithm is designed for efficiency and ease of use, making it suitable for real-time applications where performance is criticl Developers are encouraged to explore and contribute to the algorithm's development through the dedicated repositoy:
