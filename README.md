![Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic's GitHub Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic&layout=compact&theme=tokyonight&show_icons=true)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

1.C\/C#\/C++   
2.Basic code for Java/Mathematical calculations for Python/   
3.Rust\/Go ????   
4.Application and builder of cryptography (symmetry)   
5.Game Development   

## 📖 I’m currently worked done

- [TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn):
A code base of utilities that use multiple algorithms to encrypt or decrypt data, validate data, etc.
(Implement file read/write processing functionality, maybe in the future?)

- [Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic): 
A C++-based research library for symmetric encryption and decryption, containing my OaldresPuzzleCryptic and Little OaldresPuzzleCryptic algorithms (although these two algorithms are placed in the `OOP/BlockCipher` folder and the `OOP/StreamCipher` folder, they are actually mathematically different implementations. they actually use different mathematical implementations. 
I call them both by this name because these algorithms are actually very difficult to crack, and both algorithms can be a good defense against the future growth of quantum computing with respect to quantum bits, and I propose a good defense against shortening the speed of cracking. 
(And the name means: a maze of puzzles as hard to crack as a mythical dragon.) 
However, because of the design characteristics of the two ciphers themselves: the block cipher is a heavyweight cryptography, and the stream cipher is a lightweight cryptography. I hope you will like these two algorithms.


## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- [PasswordManagerGUI](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/PasswordManagerGUI):
A Utility GUI program to protect and manage passwords using my utility codebase TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn.

- [Easy-BigInteger](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/Easy-BigInteger)
A user-friendly class for working with large integers, designed with cryptography and binary math operations in mind.
The library is designed for MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) and is currently under development (Work In Progress).
Ideal for scientific computing and application scenarios that require high efficiency in bit manipulation.
Enables the representation of large numbers beyond the native capabilities of standard C++ data types.
It simplifies the creation, manipulation, and handling of large integers, and is an invaluable tool for those working with cryptographic algorithms or mathematical calculations that require the use of large numbers.

- [LargeDynamicBitSet](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/LargeDynamicBitSet):
This is a dynamic bit set implementation that utilizes arrays of 32-bit numbers.
This project is currently under development, bug reports and contributions are welcome to help improve its functionality.

- [c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit): 
A practical code toolkit written in C#. 
(This is a utility code repository, I had little interest in writing it, there may be some useful data structure and algorithmic logic functions later.)

## History until 2022 ⚙️ Project:

- [BackDoorProgram-WindowsProcessExplorer](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/BackDoorProgram-WindowsProcessExplorer): A tool for exploring Windows system process objects.
- [BackDoorProgram-WindowsSystemPowerExplorer](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/BackDoorProgram-WindowsSystemPowerExplorer): A tool for exploring Windows system power.
- [TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile): A program for calculating file data to achieve encryption and decryption.
- [MyMinecraftForgeModdingProject_SuperWorldGem_1.7.10](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/MyMinecraftForgeModdingProject_SuperWorldGem_1.7.10): A Minecraft 1.7.10 forge modding project (About SuperWorldGem).
