## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...

- [TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn): A Utility GUI tool to protect passwords and managers using my TDOM-EncryptOrDecryptFile-Reborn library based on c++.
- [PasswordManagerGUI](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/PasswordManagerGUI): A utility library for protecting your passwords and manager with use my utility tool for encrypting or decrypting files using multiple algorithms. (Maybe it's a future file handling function that will be completed?)
- [Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/Algorithm_OaldresPuzzleCryptic): A symmetric encryption and decryption library based on C++.
- [LargeDynamicBitSet](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/LargeDynamicBitSet): A bit set based on an array of 32-bit numbers. As a result, it can represent large numbers that are not representable by native c++ and can be used for scientific computing. (Under development, feel free to submit bugs.)
- [c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit](https://github.com/Twilight-Dream-Of-Magic/c-sharp-practical-code-toolkit): A practical code toolkit written in C#. (This is a utility code repository, I had little interest in writing it, there may be some useful data structure and algorithmic logic functions later.)
